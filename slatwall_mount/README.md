# HandiWALL mounts

`parts.py` contains the base mount that can be clipped to the HandiWALL statwall system, as well as multiple holders that are based on it.

Here is how the clamping works:

I recommend to print them on the side so that tension forces will work along filament lines. All holders can be printed without supports:

Some holders can be print as one piece (slatwall clamp and the mount), some have to be splitted into the clamp and a mount which can be connected together.

## Bosch 12V powertool holders

Charger mount:

Tool holders. Two variations, one that is more suitable for drills, screwdrivers etc:

and the other for longer and narrower tools (rotary tool etc):

Battery holder. This needs to be paired with the universal clamp.

Here how it looks in practice:
